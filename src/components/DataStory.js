                    Vegan is a diet in which the consumer does not eat any kind of food related to animals.
                    Neither their meat nor their indirect products like milk (and related), eggs or honey.

                    In this plot we can see the reduction in the amount of recipes due to the diet,
                    as well as the change in the percentage of healthy recipes. The number of recipes is reduced
                    by 80%, with a final amount of 545.587 recipes. This shows us how much we base our diet in
                    non-vegan products. 4 out of 5 of the recipes out there contain animal related products.
                    We can see that the percentage of unhealthy recipes decreases from 68.99% to 52.89%, making
                    vegan the easiest diet to be healthy in. This is mainly caused by the absence of butter and
                    other animal-related unhealthy products like bacon<Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[6]</Source>.

                    This plot shows the average number of ingredients per recipe in the vegan diet and the regular
                    one. There is a reduction in the vegan of 1.7 ingredients per recipe. This is a
                    significant reduction caused mainly by the lack of bakery due to the lack of egg, butter and
                    milk consumption. However, it is still a surprisingly high value. Being vegan is less
                    complex than it looks in terms of number of ingredients per recipe.

                        in carbohydrates<Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[8]</Source>: Flour (from 23.5% to 7.6%), pasta (from 3.6% to 1.5%), bread
                        (from 2.8% to 1.3%) and noodles (from 0.7% to 0.2%). If you are eating a vegan diet,
                        make sure you eat products rich in carbohydrates too. It is more common to be concerned about
                        the lack of protein, but the lack of carbohydrates is also present, but it can be avoided by
                        eating more pasta, brown rice<Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[9]</Source>, vegan bread...

                    These ingredients explain why the vegetarian diet is more related to unhealthy recipes,
                    as sugar (from 34% to 46%), butter (from 29% to 33%) and chocolate (from 4% to 6.5%) are
                    increased<Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}> [3]</Source>. The other ingredients are good news.
                    As vegetarians stop eating animal meat, they lose a great source of vitamin B12
                    <Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[10]</Source> and protein. Increasing the consumption of
                    eggs (from 27% to 33.5%), milk (from 14% to 17%) and cheese is a good way
                    to fight this lack of B12 and protein.

                    good. As said in the ingredients increasing analysis, cheese is a great source of vitamin B12 and
                    protein for vegetarians. Thus, its reduction is not welcomed. Olive oil, tomatoes and mushrooms,
                    are healthy ingredients whose reduction is never something good, even though they can be replaced.

                    Lactose intolerance is the inability to break down a type of natural sugar called lactose.
                    People with this diet do not consume any product that contains lactose.
                    The most common are milk and butter, but all of their derivatives are also inedible for them.
                    Now we will present the conclusions drawn from the analysis of how a lactose
                    free diet indirectly changes the way we eat by analyzing the recipes available for this diet.

                    as well as the change in the percentage of healthy recipes. The number of recipes is reduced
                    by 56.2%, with a final amount of 341.240 recipes. This shows us how much we base our diet in
                    dairy, with nearly half of our diets containing it. We can see that the percentage of
                    unhealthy recipes decreases from 68.99% to 54.81%, making it easier for lactose intolerant
                    people to eat healthy. This is mainly caused by the absence of butter in the diet, which as
                    we have seen above is a really dominant ingredient.

                    The most concerning ingredient here is the vegetable oil (from 11% to 16%). It is considered
                    as a great source of omega 6 which several investigations have related to cancer issues<Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[1]</Source>.
                    However, the olive oil also increases in the lactose free diet (from 19% to 24.5%). Olive oil
                    differs from vegetable oil in that its nutritional value is more complete and resistant to high
                    cooking temperatures <Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[2]</Source>. Therefore, if we are lactose intolerant we can avoid these increases
                    in vegetable oil by replacing it with olive oil. The rest of the ingredients that increase in
                    appearances, are mainly sauces. Which is not a problem in and of itself, but if these sauces are bought
                    already made, they can have huge amount of unhealthy ingredients and other components.

                ingredients vary their rate of appearances in recipes by 20%. This is a normal value, let's see
                now the most important ingredients that change their rate of appearances. Remember that the
                ingredients containing gluten such as flour are not taken into account (their consumption is
                reduced completely)

                    oat (from 2% to 1%). If you are eating a gluten free diet, make sure you look for recipes with

                    Iron deficiency is a problem that causes abnormally low levels of red blood cells. One can counter this
                    with pills given by the doctor - however, when the level of iron is
                    not extremely low, the way out is changing the diet into a iron rich one. Products rich in
                    iron are for example: Tofu, soy, olives, beef, shellfish... <Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[12, 13]</Source>

                    In this plot we can see the reduction of the amount of recipes due to the diet,
                    as well as the change in the percentage of healthy recipes. The number of recipes is reduced
                    by 57%, with a final amount of 496.426 recipes. This shows that actually eating good amounts
                    of iron is not hard to do. We can also see that the percentage of unhealthy recipes decreases
                    from 68.99% to 61.43%, making it easier for iron rich diet consumers to be healthy.

                    This is a really high increase making iron rich meals much more complex in terms of the number
                    of ingredients in them.

                    by changing into a diet rich in omega 3. Products rich in omega 3 are for example:

                    as well as the change in the percentage of healthy recipes. The number of recipes is reduced by
                    88%, with a final ammount of 88.072 recipes. This shows us how hard is to follow diets rich in
                    omega 3. This, and the fact that the consumption of omega 6 has risen the last past years<Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[19]</Source>,
                    makes. We can also see that the percentage of unhealthy recipes decreases from 68.99% to 60.92%,

                    When comparing the omega 3 rich diet with the regular one, we can see that on average,
                    ingredients vary their rate of appearances in recipes a 32%. This is a high value, so let's
                    see the most important ingredients that change their rate of appearances. Remember that the
                    ingredients rich in omega 3 such as salmon are not taken into account as they will obviously
                    increase. We are looking for indirect increases and decreases.

                    The increase of salt consumption (from 53% to 57%) is not a good change <Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[11]</Source>, however is not the
                    main concern. The increase of vegetable oil (from 11% to 14%) and mayonnaise (from 4% to 8%) are
                    more threatening for the health of consumers. The vegetable oil is considered as a great source of

                    can be done healthy, however, most of the time it is consumed pre-made with high rates of
                    vegetable oils. The increase of spicy food is more a curiosity than any other thing: Chili
                    (from 4% to 9.5%), cayenne (from 3% to 5.5%), jalapeno (from 2% to 5%)...

                    The reduction of sugar (from 34.5% to 24%) and butter (from 29% to 23%) is a healthy change and
                    explains how the diet overall is healthier than the average diet despite the increase of vegetable
                    oil. The decrease of egg (from 27% to 22%), milk (from 14% to 8%) and chicken (from 10% to 6.5%)
                    can lead to a lack of protein when following this diet. Make sure to eat enough products rich in
                    protein. Last but not least is that the consumption of fruits is drastically
                    reduced: Blueberries (from 1% to 0.5%), strawberries (from 1.5% to 0.5%), peaches, raspberries...
                    This will not be a problem if you just eat fruits as dessert.

                    rate of appearances in recipes by 45%. This is a extremely high value so let's see the most important
                    ingredients that change their rate of appearances. Remember that the ingredients that are spicy such as
                    chili are not taken into account as they will obviously increase. We are looking for indirect increases
                    and decreases.

                    These increases are actually not surprising. With only spicy food, the sweet food is not considered,
                    therefore, increases of salt (from 53% to 64%) and oils are reasonable. Just make sure the oil used is
                    olive oil and not vegetable oil <Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[1]</Source>. The increase of meat shows how related it is to spicy food: chicken
                    (from 10.5% to 16%), beef (from 6% to 9%), pork (from 3% to 5.5%) and shrimp (from 2% to 4%). The
                    increase of sauces make sense, as spicy food is generally full of them: mayonnaise (from 4% to 7%) and
                    ketchup (from 2% to 5%). The increase of other spices make total sense (spices are generally used in
                    groups): parsley (from 8.5% to 11.5%), celery (from 5.5% to 8.5%), cumin (from 4% to 14%)... These
                    changes are not unhealthy them self.

                Nowadays, huge advances in medicine and nutrition have led us to understand that the way we eat plays the most
                important role in our health. Following a diet rich in omega 6, for example, will lead us into different
                diseases, like cancer. Avoiding bad diets is “easily” achieved by eating a great variety of different food,
                while minimizing the amount of unhealthy meals. However, things can get harder when we have certain
                restrictions or obligations in our diet, for instance if we have to counter a lack of iron, or if we are vegan.

                In this research we have worked with 779.088 recipes that exist around the internet to find out hidden
                relationships between ingredients and diets. We want to know how the diet of people affects their nutrition
                in a way that was unexpected, so it can help these people improve their health. Let's say that, for example,
                you have a lactose intolerance. You already know you will not eat milk, cheese, yogurt... But is that it?
                Will there be other ingredients or groups of ingredients also reduced (or increased) because of this
                restriction? Will it be harder for you to be healthy than a person with a regular diet? Maybe even easier?
                How complex will the recipes you can access be? All this questions and more, will be answered in this article.
                The diets analyzed are the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lactose intolerance</li>
                    <li>Gluten intolerance or celiac dissease</li>
                    <li>Vegan</li>
                    <li>Vegetarian </li>
                    <li>Diet rich in iron</li>
                    <li>Diet rich in omega 3</li>
                    <li>Diet rich in magnesium</li>
                    <li>Spicy food (not really a diet, but still interesting)</li>

            <p>
                Firstly, let us present how the number of recipes available changes depending on the diet. In the plot below,
                you can see, for each diet, the number of recipes available and also the percentage compared to the total
                amount of recipes analyzed. With a 63.7% of vegetarian meals, we can see how much we base our diet in meats,
                but this is even more impressive when we talk about veganism. Around 80% of the recipes out there contain
                animal related products. The amount of recipes with lactose is also surprising with 56.2%, and with gluten
                by almost 30%. In terms of the 3 diets rich in a specific nutrient, the most relevant is the omega 3. Several
                studies have talked about the problem of omega 3 to omega 6 ratio in our bodies (should be 1:1)
                <Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[19]</Source>, and we
                can see how hard is to find recipes rich in omega 3 with only 11% of the total number of recipes.

            <p>
                We have labeled recipes as healthy or unhealthy based on their ingredients <Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[21-34]</Source> as we wanted to see how did
                the percentage of healthy recipes changed depending on your diet. If you are a vegan or vegetarian you will
                for sure eat more vegetables, however, this does not mean you will be more healthy, there are plenty of
                products vegans or vegetarians can eat that are considered as unhealthy. Actually, as you can see in the
                plot below, the vegetarian diet is the only diet that has an increase in the number of unhealthy
                recipes. The rest of the diets (some more, some less) make it easier for the consumer to eat healthy, with a higher
                healthy-to-unhealthy ratio. However, we are still far away from a good situation, as in every diet more than
                half of the recipes contain unhealthy ingredients.
            </p>
            <iframe width={1000} height={500} className={classes.plot} frameBorder={0} src={"./healthinessPerDiet.html"}/>
            <p>
                You may wonder how is this possible. How come so many recipes are unhealthy. The answer is easier than you
                think. Nowadays, we base our diet in a few ingredients that can be found in a lot of the recipes out there.
                This are the "dominant ingredients". In the scatter plot below, you can see the top 265 most common
                ingredients and the amount of recipes they are on (out of 779.088). As said before, these dominant
                ingredients condition the way we eat much more than a group of the non-dominant ones. Some of them, like
                sugar (2nd) or butter (4th) are considered as unhealthy, and that is why many recipes are so unhealthy.
            </p>
            <iframe height={500} frameBorder={0} className={classes.plot} src={"./scatterPlotIngredients.html"}/>
            <p>
                Now, having seen all this, we have done an analysis of the relationships between ingredients, how much ingredients
                are correlated with each other. This way we can study how the restriction of specific ingredients affects the
                consumption rate of others and at the end, our nutrition. Below you can see as an example, a heatmap that
                shows the relationship of the dominant ingredients, whose relationships are the most important of the
                analysis. If you want to look for information on a specific ingredient, because you are allergic, you do not
                like it, or you love it too much, check out our awesome <RouterLink className={classes.link} to={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + "/search"}>search tool!</RouterLink> There you will find the relationships of
                any ingredient (265 ingredients available) with the rest, and more information of its presence in diets.

                Moving on, we now present the analysis in detail of each diet. You will be able to see the healthiness analysis in a
                more intense way, a complexity analysis of the diet based on the ingredients complexity as well as the
                instruction complexity and, thanks to the correlation of ingredients mention before, an analysis of the
                consumption shifts caused indirectly by the diet.

                    The way we eat is going to play a big role on our health and so in our life in general. We have seen that following specific diets can mean much more than it looks like. Eventhough this analysis has some flaws, like we do not take into account the quantity of each ingredient in a recipe, or how popular each recipes is; we hope this can show people with specific diets how to eat in a more balanced and healthy way. At the end of the day, the recipes are there, but it is us who choose which ones to make.
