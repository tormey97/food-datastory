                Nowadays, huge advances in medicine and nutrition have led us to understand that the way we eat plays the most
                important role in our health. Following a diet rich in omega 6, for example, will lead us into different
                diseases, like cancer. Avoiding bad diets is “easily” achieved by eating a great variety of different food,
                while minimizing the amount of unhealthy meals. However, things can get harder when we have certain
                restrictions or obligations in our diet, for instance if we have to counter a lack of iron, or if we are vegan.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this research we have worked with 779.088 recipes that exist around the internet to find out hidden
                relationships between ingredients and diets. We want to know how the diet of people affects their nutrition
                in a way that was unexpected, so it can help these people improve their health. Let's say that, for example,
                you have a lactose intolerance. You allready know you will not eat milk, cheese, yogurt... But is that it?
                Will there be other ingredients or grups of ingredients also reduced (or increased) because of this
                restriction? Will it be harder for you to be healthy than a person with a regular diet? Maybe even easier?
                How complex will the recipes you can access be? All this questions and more, will be answer in this article.
                The diets analyzed are the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lactose intolerance</li>
                    <li>Gluten intolerance or celiac dissease</li>
                    <li>Vegan</li>
                    <li>Vegetarian </li>
                    <li>Diet rich in iron</li>
                    <li>Diet rich in omega 3</li>
                    <li>Diet rich in magnesium</li>
                    <li>Spicy food (not really a diet, but still interesting)</li>
                </ul>

                You do not follow any of these diets? Do not leave yet, there are things for you too here...

function GeneralSection({sourcesRef}) {
    const classes = useStyles();

        <Typography className={classes.mainText}>
            <Typography variant={"h5"}>
                The "Food Business"

            <Divider/>
            <p>
                Let's first take a look at the consideration that our diet has from institutions and the general opinion.
                Several surveys have been conducted all over Europe in the last two decades, with the goal to better understand
                how people eating habits evolve over time. That shows a real interest from institutions on the matter. Here we
                have an overview on the range those eating habits studies:
            </p>
            <iframe width={1000} height={650} className={classes.plot} frameBorder={0} src={"./gant1.html"}/>
            <p>
                These have been proven useful to spot eating habits trends, thus providing the chance of addressing possible
                future issues. As an example, the alcohol consumption in Spain has been affected by two opposite trends from
                early 2000's on: consumption in adults has been decreasing, while consumption in adolescents has increased
                considerably, so much that it surpassed the adults' value (values are expressed as grams per kilograms of body
                weight):
            </p>
            <img src="alcohol.svg" width={600} style={{width: "50%", marginLeft: "auto", marginRight: "auto", display: "block"}}/>
            <p>
                On the other side, interest on the matter from the general opinion is still far from ideal. Comparing the ideal
                food pyramid model with the average real one for one country can give a general idea about the food education
                of a population. For example, we can check the situation in UK:
            </p>
            <iframe width={1000} height={500} className={classes.plot} src={"./UKPyramid.html"}/>
            <p>
                As we can see, british diet shows a serious lack of vegetables, fruit and grain-based products, but is generally
                below the recommended values in all the food types included in the food pyramid. That is due to the fact that
                the model doesn't comprise all possible food categories, like alcoholic beverages, which are overconsumed by the
                british population.
            </p>
            <p>
                As another example, Spain shows a different scenario:
            </p>
            <iframe width={1000} height={500} className={classes.plot} src={"./spainPyramid.html"}/>
            <p>
                It can be seen as the spanish population is much more balanced on the pyramid food types, consuming only
                slightly more meat, seafood, eggs and dairy products than recommended. Similarly as UK, though, their diet
                shows a lacking in grain-based products, vegetables and fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
                From this introduction we get that eating behaviours, trends and threir effects are a phenomenon of interest
                for institutions, but still not well received by the general population. Often people do not consume the
                recommended quantities of the different food types, which can cause health related issues. A deeper analysis on
                this aspect awaits you in the followin section.
