The\r\n                    increase of sauces make sense, as spicy food is generaly full of them: mayonnaise (from 4% to 7%) and\r\n                    ketchup (from 2% to 5%). The increase of other spicies makes total sense (spicies are generaly used in\r\n                    groups): parsley (from 8.5% to 11.5%), celery (from 5.5% to 8.5%), cumin (from 4% to 14%)...

Following a diet rich in omega 6, for example, will lead us into different\r\n                diseases, like cancer. Avoiding bad diets is “easily” achieved by eating a great variety of different food,\r\n                while minimizing the amount of unhealthy meals. However, things can get harder when we have certain\r\n                restrictions or obligations in our diet, for instance if we have to counter a lack of iron, or if we are vegan.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                In this research we have worked with 779.088 recipes that exist arround the internet to find out hidden\r\n                relationships between ingredients and diets. We want to know how the diet of people affects their nutrition\r\n                in a way that was unexpected, so it can help these people improve their health. Let's say that, for example,\r\n                you have a lactose intolerance. You allready know you will not eat milk, cheese, yogurt... But is that it?\r\n                Will there be other ingredients or grups of ingredients also reduced (or increased) because of this\r\n                restriction? Will it be harder for you to be healthy than a person with a regular diet? Maybe even easier?\r\n                How complex will the recipes you can access be? All this questions and more, will be answer in this article.\r\n                The diets analyzed are the following:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>Lactose intolerance</li>\r\n                    <li>Gluten intolerance or celiac dissease</li>\r\n                    <li>Vegan</li>\r\n                    <li>Vegetarian </li>\r\n                    <li>Diet rich in iron</li>\r\n                    <li>Diet rich in omega 3</li>\r\n                    <li>Diet rich in magnesium</li>\r\n                    <li>Spicy food (not really a diet, but still interesting)</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n\r\n                You do not follow any of these diets? Do not leave yet, there are things for you too here...\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Firstly, let us present how the number of recipes available changes depending on the diet. In the plot below,\r\n                you can see for each diet, the number of recipes available and also the percentage compared to the total\r\n                amount of recipes analyzed. With a 63.7% of vegetarian meals, we can see how much we base our diet in meats,\r\n                but this is even more impressing when we talk about veganism. Arround 80% of the recipes out there contain\r\n                animal related products. The ammount of recipes with lactose is also surpsing with a 56.2%, and with gluten\r\n                a almost 30%. In terms of the 3 diets rich in a specific nutrient, the most relevant is the omega 3. Several\r\n                studies have talked about the problem of omega 3 to omega 6 ratio in our bodies (should be 1:1)\r\n                <Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[19]</Source>, and we\r\n                can see how hard is to find recipes rich in omega 3 with only a 11% of the total number of recipes.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width={1000} height={500} className={classes.plot} src={\"./recipesPerDiet.html\"}/>\r\n            <p>\r\n                We have labeled recipes as healthy or unhealthy based on their ingredients <Source sourcesRef={sourcesRef}>[21-34]</Source> as we wanted to see how did\r\n                the percentage of healthy recipes changed depending on your diet. If you are a vegan or vegetarian you will\r\n                for sure eat more vegetables, however, this does not mean you will be more healthy, there are plenty of\r\n                products vegans or vegetarians can eat that are considered as unhealthy. Actually, as you can see in the\r\n                plot below, vegetarain diet is the only diet that has a percentual increase on the number of unhealthy\r\n                recipes. The rest of the diets (some more, some less) make consumer easier to eat healthy, with a higher\r\n                healthy-to-unhealthy ratio. However, we are still far away from a good situation, as in every diet more than\r\n                half of the recipes contain unhealthy ingredients.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width={1000} height={500} className={classes.plot} frameBorder={0} src={\"./healthinessPerDiet.html\"}/>\r\n            <p>\r\n                You may woneder how is this posible. Howcome so many recipes are unhealthy. The answer is easier than you\r\n                think. Nowadays, we base our diet in a few ingredients that can be found in a lot of the recipes out there.\r\n                This are the \"dominant ingredients\". In the scatter plot below, you can see the top 265 most common\r\n                ingredients and the ammount of recipes they are on (out of 779.088). As said before, these dominant\r\n                ingredients condition the way we eat much more than a group of the non-dominant ones. Some of them, like\r\n                sugar (2nd) or butter (4th) are considered as unhealthy, and that why many recipes are so unhealthy.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe height={500} frameBorder={0} className={classes.plot} src={\"./scatterPlotIngredients.html\"}/>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Now, having seen all this, we have done an analysis of the relationships between ingredients, how much ingredients\r\n                are correlated with each other. This way we can study how the restriction of spcific ingredients affects the\r\n                consumption rate of others and at the end, our nutrition. Below you can see as an example, a heatmap that\r\n                shows the relationship of the dominant ingredients, whose relationships are the most important of the\r\n                analysis. If you want to look for information on a spcific ingredient, because you are alergic, you do not\r\n                like it, or you love it too much, check out our awsome <RouterLink className={classes.link} to={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/search\"}>search tool!</RouterLink> There you will find the relationship of\r\n                any ingredient (265 ingredients available) with the rest, and more information of its presence in diets.\r\n\r\n            </p>\r\n            <iframe width={1000} height={750} frameBorder={0} className={classes.plot} src={\"./heatMapOfTop10Ingredients.html\"}/>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Moving on, we now present the analysis in detail of each diet. You will be able to see the healtiness analysis in a\r\n                more intense way, a complexity analysis of the diet based on the ingredients complexity as well as the\r\n                instruction complexity and, thanks to the correlation of ingredients mention before, an analysis of the\r\n                consumption shifts caused indirectly by the diet.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </Typography>)\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction DataStory() {\r\n    const classes = useStyles();\r\n    const [selectedDiet, setSelectedDiet] = React.useState(0);\r\n\r\n    const sourcesRef = React.useRef(null);\r\n    const executeScroll = () => scrollToRef(sourcesRef);\r\n\r\n    const changeDiet = (event, value) => {\r\n        console.log(value);\r\n\r\n        setSelectedDiet(value)\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className={classes.toolbar}/>\r\n            <div className={classes.headerSection}>\r\n                <Typography variant={\"h4\"}>\r\n                    How we eat\r\n                </Typography>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className={classes.section}>\r\n                <Typography variant={\"h5\"}>\r\n                    Introduction\r\n                </Typography>\r\n                <Divider/>\r\n                <GeneralSection/>\r\n                {/**/}\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div className={classes.section}>\r\n                <Typography variant={\"h5\"}>\r\n                    Dietary restrictions\r\n                </Typography>\r\n                <Divider/>\r\n                <Typography className={classes.mainText}>\r\n                    <p>There are many common diets that people adhere to.
